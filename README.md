# Bachelor-Project

## Description of the project

The aim of the project was understanding how DeepLabCut, used for 2D or 3D markerless pose estimation, works and what would be the best way to find outliers of this toolbox, using mostly clustering. 
This project contains Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) and Python files.
This is a Bachelor Project done during the Life Sciences Engineering Bachelor at EPFL.
